<h1>Theresa's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>A lonely, quirky young woman finds loves while helping those around her.That's 
    an extremely simply way to describe this movie. There's so much to say about it The cinematography is 
    beautiful, the soundtrack is georgous, and the acting is five stars.
</p>
<h3>Clueless</h3>
<p>Maybe this is a guilty pleasure, or maybe I'm just showing my age,
    but Clueless is wonderful. It is also similar to Amelie and also quite different. It is about a rich girl who
    ends up helping people and finding love.
</p>
<h3>The Exorcist</h3>
<p>A mom desperate to find out what is wrong with her daughter
    turns to the church for an exorcism.
